VELY — Uber for Haircuts (Replit App Build Prompt)

Overview:
I want to build VELY — a mobile-first, dual-sided web app (and future native app) where customers can book on-demand or scheduled haircuts at home, and stylists/barbers can accept bookings, manage schedules, and get paid. Think Uber but for hair services.

Core Functionality

For Clients:
- User registration and login (email or phone-based)
- Search for local stylists based on service, location, reviews, and hair type specialization
- View detailed stylist profiles (bio, pricing, services, portfolio images)
- Book a stylist (immediately or in the future)
- Pay securely in-app (Stripe integration)
- See booking history and rebook favorite stylists
- Rate and review stylists after each service (1 to 5 stars + optional comments)

For Stylists/Barbers:
- Create a public profile with bio, certifications, service list, pricing, and availability
- Set travel radius and working hours
- Accept/reject appointments
- Real-time notifications for job opportunities
- Dashboard with upcoming appointments and completed jobs
- View reviews and average rating
- Receive payouts via Stripe Connect

Tech Stack Preferences:
- Frontend: HTML/CSS and JavaScript (React preferred)
- Backend: Node.js with Express
- Database: Firebase or MongoDB
- Authentication: Firebase Auth or similar
- Payments: Stripe (test keys acceptable for MVP)
- Geolocation: Google Maps API (for displaying stylist proximity)

Inclusion & Accessibility:
- Interface must be accessible (WCAG-compliant, large tap targets, legible text)
- Include diverse imagery and language representing all hair types, genders, races, and cultures
- App must work well on mobile (responsive design)

Launch Details:
This MVP is intended for real-world testing in Toronto and Los Angeles.

MVP Features for Delivery:
1. Landing Page
2. User Registration (Client & Stylist)
3. Profile Creation and Viewing
4. Search and Filter System
5. Booking System with Time Picker
6. Payment Flow (mock/test mode)
7. Dashboard View for Both Roles
8. Rating and Review System

Future features can include: calendar sync, loyalty rewards, notifications, referral tracking, and emergency safety tools.

Please structure the app for future scalability to native mobile using React Native or similar frameworks.
